# Bank System (JDBC)

### Implemented a simple banking system that allows users to create/delete accounts, withdraw/deposit money and view their transactions. Users can also change their passwords and usernames. The app interacts with a PostgreSQL database, where information on users is contained. The tables in the database interact with eachother using foreign keys, which simplifies it since I can update/add tables without having to affect the main table.
